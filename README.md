# MCUtoFPGA_TimerButton_FPGA
By using pmod, STM32F411RE transfers data to basys3.

It's timer counter that counts every 0.1 seconds and has 2 buttons, run and reset. when you want to start or stop the timer, push the run button. If you want to reset the time, push the reset button.

I can't upload this to TimerButton repository... I'll study git and github...

Anyway it's verilog code.
